wqet_grader.init("Project 1 Assessment")


# In this assignment, you'll work with a dataset of homes for sale in Brazil. Your goal is to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market. Also, you will look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price, similar to what you saw with housing in some states in Mexico.

#     <b>Note:</b> There are are 19 graded tasks in this assignment, but you only need to complete 18. Once you've successfully completed 18 tasks, you'll be automatically enrolled in the next project, and this assignment will be closed. This means that you might not be allowed to complete the last task. So if you get an error saying that you've already complete the course, that's good news! Move to project 2.

# Import Matplotlib, pandas, and plotly
import pandas as pd

import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# # Prepare Data

# In this assignment, you'll work with real estate data from Brazil.  In the `data` directory for this project there are two CSV that you need to import and clean.

# ## Import

# **Task 1.5.1:** Import the CSV file `data/brasil-real-estate-1.csv` into the DataFrame `df1`.

# In[18]:


df1 = pd.read_csv('data/brasil-real-estate-1.csv')
df1.head()


# In[19]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.1", df1)


# Before you move to the next task, take a moment to inspect `df1` using the `info` and `head` methods. What issues do you see in the data? What cleaning will you need to do before you can conduct your analysis?

# In[20]:


df1.info()


# **Task 1.5.2:** Drop all rows with `NaN` values from the DataFrame `df1`.

# In[21]:


df1.dropna(inplace=True)
df1.head()


# In[22]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.2", df1)


# **Task 1.5.3:** Use the `"lat-lon"` column to create two separate columns in `df1`: `"lat"` and `"lon"`. Make sure that the data type for these new columns is `float`.

# In[23]:


df1[["lat", "lon"]] = df1["lat-lon"].str.split(",", expand=True)
df1.info()
df1.head()


# In[24]:


df1["lat"] = df1.lat.astype(float)
df1['lon'] = df1.lon.astype(float)
df1.head


# In[25]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.3", df1)


# **Task 1.5.4:** Use the `"place_with_parent_names"` column to create a `"state"` column for `df1`. (Note that the state name always appears after `"|Brasil|"` in each string.)

# In[26]:


df1.loc[:,'state'] = df1.loc[:,'place_with_parent_names'].str.split('|', expand=True)[2]

df1.head()


# In[110]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.4", df1)


# **Task 1.5.5:** Transform the `"price_usd"` column of `df1` so that all values are floating-point numbers instead of strings. 

# In[28]:


df1["price_usd"]=df1.price_usd.str.replace('$','')
df1["price_usd"]=df1.price_usd.str.replace(',','')
df1.head()


# In[29]:


df1['price_usd'] = df1.price_usd.astype(float)
df1.head()


# In[30]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.5", df1)


# In[ ]:





# **Task 1.5.6:** Drop the `"lat-lon"` and `"place_with_parent_names"` columns from `df1`.

# In[31]:


df1=df1.drop('lat-lon', axis='columns')
df1=df1.drop('place_with_parent_names', axis='columns')
df1.head()


# In[32]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.6", df1)


# **Task 1.5.7:** Import the CSV file `brasil-real-estate-2.csv` into the DataFrame `df2`.

# In[33]:


df2 = pd.read_csv('data/brasil-real-estate-2.csv')


# In[34]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.7", df2)


# Before you jump to the next task, take a look at `df2` using the `info` and `head` methods. What issues do you see in the data? How is it similar or different from `df1`?

# In[35]:


df2.info()


# In[36]:


df2.head()


# **Task 1.5.8:** Use the `"price_brl"` column to create a new column named `"price_usd"`. (Keep in mind that, when this data was collected in 2015 and 2016, a US dollar cost 3.19 Brazilian reals.)

# In[37]:


df2['price_usd'] = df2['price_brl'] / 3.19
df2.head()


# In[38]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.8", df2)


# **Task 1.5.9:** Drop the `"price_brl"` column from `df2`, as well as any rows that have `NaN` values. 

# In[39]:


df2=df2.drop('price_brl', axis='columns')
df2.head()


# In[40]:


df2.dropna(inplace=True)
df2.head()


# In[41]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.9", df2)


# **Task 1.5.10:** Concatenate `df1` and `df2` to create a new DataFrame named `df`. 

# In[71]:


df = pd.concat([df1, df2])
print("df shape:", df.shape)


# In[72]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.10", df)

#     <p><b>Frequent Question:</b> I can't pass this question, and I don't know what I've done wrong. ðŸ˜  What's happening?</p>
#     <p><b>Tip:</b> In this assignment, you're working with data that's similar â€” but not identical â€” the data used in the lessons. That means that you might need to make adjust the code you used in the lessons to work here. Take a second look at <code>df1</code> after you complete 1.5.6, and make sure you've correctly created the state names.</p>

# ## Explore

# It's time to start exploring your data. In this section, you'll use your new data visualization skills to learn more about the regional differences in the Brazilian real estate market.
# 
# Complete the code below to create a `scatter_mapbox` showing the location of the properties in `df`.

# In[73]:

    width=600,
    height=600,
    hover_data=["price_usd"],  # Display price when hovering mouse over house
)

fig.update_layout(mapbox_style="open-street-map")

fig.show()


# **Task 1.5.11:** Use the `describe` method to create a DataFrame `summary_stats` with the summary statistics for the `"area_m2"` and `"price_usd"` columns.

# In[74]:


summary_stats = df[['area_m2','price_usd']].describe()
summary_stats.head()


# In[75]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.11", summary_stats)


# **Task 1.5.12:** Create a histogram of `"price_usd"`. Make sure that the x-axis has the label `"Price [USD]"`, the y-axis has the label `"Frequency"`, and the plot has the title `"Distribution of Home Prices"`.

# In[78]:


plt.hist(df["price_usd"])
plt.xlabel("Price [USD]")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Home Prices")
# Don't change the code below

# **Task 1.5.13:** Create a horizontal boxplot of `"area_m2"`. Make sure that the x-axis has the label `"Area [sq meters]"` and the plot has the title `"Distribution of Home Sizes"`.

# **Task 1.5.14:** Use the `groupby` method to create a Series named `mean_price_by_region` that shows the mean home price in each region in Brazil, sorted from smallest to largest.

# In[86]:


mean_price_by_region = df.groupby("region")["price_usd"].mean().sort_values()
mean_price_by_region


# In[87]:



wqet_grader.grade("Project 1 Assessment", "Task 1.5.14", mean_price_by_region)


# **Task 1.5.15:** Use `mean_price_by_region` to create a bar chart. Make sure you label the x-axis as `"Region"` and the y-axis as `"Mean Price [USD]"`, and give the chart the title `"Mean Home Price by Region"`.

# In[91]:
